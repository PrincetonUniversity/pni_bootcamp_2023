    "# Sample spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample spaces are the fundamental building blocks of probability theory. Here's an example using a scenario from a typical systems neurosceince experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine there's a mouse in an experiment box with two levers available. We'll call them lever $f$ for food and lever $w$ or water, when the mouse pulls the appropriate lever it gets either food or water.  When the mouse makes a choice to select either of two, the **random event** of the mouse picking a lever crystalizes into an sample (namely that either water or food appear). The sample space here is the set of all choices the mouse can make. So if we denote the sample space by the script $\\mathbb{S}$, it has two sets in it: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{S} = \\big(f, w \\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f$ is the set that contains food, while $w$ is the set that contains water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's further say that $f$ consists of 3 different foods $f = \\{oats, seeds, apples\\}$ and that the set $w$ consists of 3 flavors of water $w = \\{lemon, strawberry, cucumber\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, a sample space is the space of all possible things that can happen in an experiment. In this case the sample space consists of two sets, and each of those sets has multiple elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{S} = \\big(f = \\{oats, seeds, apples\\}, w = \\{lemon, strawberry, cucumber\\} \\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The term random variable is a misnomer. Random variables are neither random nor variables. Random variables are **functions**, that take as input random events (this is where the randomness comes in) and **deterministically map** those events to some output space. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be overly technical for a moment we'll denote a random variable by a capital letter, then say $P(A = a)$ is the probability that the random variable $A$ equals the specific value $a$. We can be messy with notation and instead of writing $P(A = a)$,  simply write $P(a)$. While the above is sloppy, it isn't incorrect. On the other hand, if someone writes $P(A)$ and they really do intend $A$ to be a random variable, they are confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the systems neurscience example of the mouse picking a lever to press, we'll say that the random variable is the process of the mouse making the choice. Then when the choice is made, the event of food or water appearing cyrstalizes. Notice that the randomness is in the animal making the choice. However when the choice is made, it always deterministically maps to either food or water.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability function is a function that assigns a numerical value between 0 and 1, to the outcome of a random variable. It says \"what is the probability (which is between 0 and 1) that the random variable takes on a certain value\". Going with our running example we'll denote $C$ as the random variable of the mouses choice. Then, if we want to denote the probability of getting water, we'd write \n",

    "# Distributions of random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of a random variable specifies the probabilities of **all** events associated with the random variable. There are commonly known distributions that you'll get to know later on. For now, we'll make our own distribution using our running example. \n",

    "If you’re recording calcium fluorsences from the brain, this data will be positive and negative. Perhaps positive when something rewarding happens. Perhaps negative when the animal was expecting a reward but didn't receive one. This data is continuous, it has non-zero floating point representations on the computer. We can use these facts to select a family of probability distributions to model the data. A good candidate in this case would be the gaussian since it too is continuous, taking on positive and negative values.\n",

    "But how do you use this distribution to summarize the data? Say you have data from an entire session of training an animal. You typically want to look at specific periods of the session (like when the animal makes a choice). One way to try and understand what happens when an animal makes a choice is to ask, on average, what is the response in the neural data when the animal makes a choice? We can answer this question using important quantities of the probability distribution we have chosen. For our gaussian distribution, we’d be interested in looking at the mean of the gaussian. We’ve now made an explicit link between the average response at choice time, and the mean of the gaussian distribution. \n",

    "Now the question becomes, how do we do it? Can we just say the average response is the mean? We can, but that’s not super helpful. Typically we want to say that the average response is the mean, and that mean is itself a result of some mathematical operation that takes into account peri-stimulus-choice time relevant events. For example, the animal has to consider the evidence (in a sensory decision making task) in front of it, and then make a choice. This takes us to our next step. We want to say the mean is equal to some task - relevant events multiplied by some unknowns that weigh the importance of those events.

    "# Explicit links between modelling and probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example we saw there was a bit of blurring of the lines between understanding probability distributions on their own, and modelling with those distributions. This blurring is intentional because you'll want to **use** those tools (probability theory), rather than just memorize certain definitions about them. There is a general framework for thinking about modelling with probability theory called Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that you'll learn more about in week 3. A super quick and simplified description on GLMs is that they consist of a few key components: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A probability family\n",
    "* The data you want to explain e.g. $y$\n",
    "* A link function and more specifically inverse link function\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've already talked about the first bullet points, I'll just focus on the third one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that probability distributions are generally not defined in terms of the task relevant events we want to use to model the data. Instead we posit that there are some unknown parameters denoted by $w$ that multiply those task relevant events $x$ and that product is somehow related to parameters of the distribution. In the Gaussian example we were able to explicity link the product $xw$ to the mean of the distrubtion. In general this is not possible. To get around this hurdle we use a linking function, appropriated named as \"link functions\". Thier inverses provide us with a map between the product $xw$ and the parameters of the distributions we are interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Gaussian example we also have a link function and it's inverse, which is just the identity link function, which I will denote as $I(\\cdot)$. That is for any input $z$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(z) = z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I^{-1}(z) = z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "so, if we thinking of the mean of the Gaussian distribution $mu$ we have: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = I^{-1}(xw) = xw$$\n",
    "\n",
    "below we have an example of the PDF of a Gaussian, where we explicitly define in code it's inverse link funtion, and then use that to compute the PDF of the data $y$, given $w, x, \\sigma^2$"

Now we'll look at a different distribution that is discrete. It's the Bernoulli family of distributions and it has the following **probability mass function** (PMF)\n",

Also $\\theta$ must be some number between $0$ and $1$, for example $0.56$ . The data consist of a set of  binary outcomes. As such, this might be a good candidate for a distribution when we need to model behavior that has two possible outcomes. With that in mind, let's ask the same question of, how do we make sense of data with this distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider again the situation where an animal sees a stimulus and must make a binary choice based off of the stimulus. Just like in example above we'll say the stimulus is denoted by the variable $x$, and it is weighed by some unknown $w$. In the calcium example we were able to say $\\mu = xw$, and that was the end of it, because $\\mu$ could be any number. We can't do that here because $\\theta$ is restricted to be any number between 0 and 1. \n",

    "# A Poisson distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the theme we'll now look into yet another common distribution that can be used to help us summarize neuroscience data. This family is called the Poisson family of distributions. Like the Bernoulli family it is discrete. The type of data it models are counts, non-negative integers such as 5 or 3. Given this information we might reason that it's a natural choice to model spike counts from ephys experiments. It has the following PMF, where now $y$ is the number of spikes\n",
    "\n",
    " $$p(y; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^y e ^{-\\lambda}}{y!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "in this example, just like in the Bernoulli example notice that the function is not initially parametrized in terms of $x$ (stimulus) or $w$ (weights on stimulus), but instead using the parameter $\\lambda$. Just like in the Bernoulli example we'll use a function to relate $\\lambda$ to the product $xw$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That function is **($g(\\cdot)$ is the inverse link function for the poisson)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = g(x, w) = e^{xw}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "giving us the PMF in terms of this function as:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$p(y; x, w, g(\\cdot)) = \\frac{g(x, w)^y e ^{-g(x, w)}}{y!}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "in the choice data example above we gave the motivation that because the parameter that a Bernoulli distribution takes has to be between 0 and 1, we need the sigmoid function to transform the product $xw$ into the correct range. Poisson distributions also have a contraint, namely that $\\lambda >= 0$. The function $g(\\cdot)$ ensures this. To see this note that in general $log(u) = a \\times b$ necessarily imples that $u = e^{a \\times b}$, and log function is undefined for real-valued negative numbers. Plugging this in we have: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$log(\\lambda) = xw \\ge 0$$"
