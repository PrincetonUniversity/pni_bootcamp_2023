    "Having more observations than features is the typical setting for linear regression.\n",
    "When $n \\ge m$, the matrix rank can be at most $m$, so $rank(\\textbf{A}) \\le m$.\n",
    "If the features are linearly independent, then $rank(\\textbf{A}) = m$, so $rank(\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}) = m$, which makes it invertible, so we can compute the solution $\\textbf{x}^*$ above. When $n > m$, we won't generally be able to find a solution so that $\\textbf{A}\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}$, but our solution will have minimum error.\n",

These $\\textbf{b}$ with a perfect solution must be in $col(\\textbf{A})$, and are unique since our columns are linearly independent. However, notice that our $\\textbf{x}$ can have at most two elements -- this means we can only generate a two-dimensional output space, even though the size of $\\textbf{b}$ is four! So, there are many $\\textbf{b}$ that we _can't_ solve exactly, like $\\begin{bmatrix} 7 & -6 & 3 & -4 \\end{bmatrix}$. But, you can get a close solution $\\textbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix} 6.5 & 3.5 \\end{bmatrix}$. So, regression looks for an approximation of $\\textbf{b}$ that's actually in $col(\\textbf{A})$."

    "However, things are different if our features are linearly dependent. In that case, $rank(\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A})<m$, so we can't invert the matrix $\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}$ to compute a solution. Intuitively, it's no longer possible to find a unique solution, since some columns can be rewritten in terms of others. So even though we can solve some problems and approximate the rest, having linearly dependent columns means there are always infinite solutions, whether they are exact or approximate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related issue can also occur with columns that are collinear, but not entirely linearly dependent. In particular, even when $\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}$ can be inverted, correlated columns can make it difficult to interpret the weights $\\textbf{x}^*$. For example, in a simple case with two nearly-identical columns, any combination of those two columns will result in similar error, which will cause estimates of their standard deviations to be large. While the model on the whole can still achieve low error, it might be difficult to understand which of the two columns is contributing most because of their relationship. Highly collinear columns can also cause numerical issues with inverting $\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}$. More details are on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity#Consequences), or in Cosma Shalizi's [course notes (in section 5)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/14/lecture-14.pdf).\n",

    "This corresponds to cases where, intuitively, you would be overfitting data when fititng a regression model. We examine these issues by using linear algebra.\n",

    "When $n < m$, the matrix rank can be at most $n$, so $rank(\\textbf{A}) \\le n$. But $size(\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A})$ is $m \\times m$. That means that $rank(\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}) \\le n < m$, so $\\textbf{A}^T\\textbf{A}$ is not full rank, so we can't take an inverse. This also makes sense intuitively; having more features than observations means that some features will be linearly dependent, so there are infinite solutions. When $rank(\\textbf{A}) < n$, it is also possible to have no solutions, since there are fewer linearly independent vectors than there are observations. Intuitively, we can think of these cases as analogous to our problematic matrix above.\n",
