# Linear Algebra - bootcamp lectures

Led by Carlos G. Correa on Thursday, August 10, 2023 from 1:30pm to 4:30pm.

Overall plan is to focus on two different topics, with a break in between. The last part of the day will be an informal office hours, where I'll stick around to answer any questions people might have.
